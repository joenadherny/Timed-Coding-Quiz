# Description 
This assingment focused on making a timed coding quiz that would have userss answer questions related to coding. If they get one wrong time would be subtracted from the clock until time expires. User is then prompted with saving intiials and score. I used stack overflow along with Chat GPT as resources to hep me as I got stuck. Sadly could not figure out a way for the high scores to display for saving but everything else seems to be working smoothly.
